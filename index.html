        <h1 class="ui header">Hi, I'm Finbarr</h1>
        <p>I'm a software engineer at Y Combinator and CEO & Co-Founder of Shogun. I'm a Scottish guy living in California and one of the first results on Google for Finbarr!</p>
        <p>Previously I've built two businesses, <a href="https://getshogun.com" title="Shogun" target="_blank">Shogun</a> (a CMS with over 600 paying customers) and a web development business I started when I was 18. I love finding creative coding solutions, and I've written code to process millions of dollars worth of orders at companies like <a href="https://getpebble.com" title="Pebble" target="_blank">Pebble</a>, <a href="https://groupon.com" title="Groupon" target="_blank">Groupon</a> and <a href="https://iamexec.com" title="Exec" target="_blank">Exec</a>.</p>

        <p>Along with good friends Joel Pobar and Sandra Lennie, I won 3rd place at BMW's <a href="http://www.hackthedrive.com/" title="Hack The Drive" target="_blank">Hack The Drive</a> Hackathon in San Francisco (early 2015). We re-imagined the car speedometer for safety and created SafeSpeedo.</p>

        <p>I built <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waffle-photo-message-collages/id914408764" title="Waffle" target="_blank">Waffle</a>, a picture messaging app for iPhone.

        <p>I built <a href="http://giveit100.com" title="Giveit100" target="_blank">Giveit100</a>, a video site for people to make inspirational progress videos from their practice footage. The website has over 100,000 members with a combined 40 million video views. Giveit100 innovates in video - the videos play instantly when you hover your mouse over them. Because we have hundreds of videos per page, we tackled many performance challenges.</p>

        <p>At <a href="https://getpebble.com" title="Pebble" target="_blank">Pebble</a>, I rewrote the system that handles all monetary transactions and created a new internal dashboard for managing orders. This system is used to process all purchases made on the site.</p>
        <p>I also built a system to manage the pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises" title="Pebble Time Smartwatch" target="_blank">Pebble Time Smartwatch</a> - the most successful Kickstarter campaign of all time.</p>

        <p>I was the senior engineer at <a href="http://iamexec.com" title="Exec" target="_blank">Exec</a>, where I developed algorithms to schedule thousands of deliveries, errands, and house cleanings. These artificial intelligence and constraint satisfaction algorithms set the schedules for hundreds of workers - giving them more stable hours while simultaneously improving utilization. These changes significantly increased Exec’s operating margin.</p>
        <p>I mentored the dev team and taught the extended team (marketing, design, and operations) to code in Ruby. Exec was nominated for the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/2012-crunchies-finalists/" title="Crunchies" target="_blank">Fastest Rising Startup at the 2012 Crunchies</a>, and sold to <a href="http://www.handy.com/" title="Handy" target="_blank">Handy</a> in early 2014.</p>

        <p><a href="http://awesomebabyname.com" title="Awesome Baby Name" target="_blank">Awesome Baby Name</a> is a baby name generator with an SEO twist: it finds unique names based on available domain names. My co-founder Karen and I built it in a weekend at a hackathon. In just one week, over 100,000 people had tried it. The idea came from a joke - because Karen has such a common name, she couldn’t get karencheng.com. I thought there should be a website that makes sure newborns never have this problem.</p>
        <p>We ended up selling it on <a href="https://flippa.com/3931669-awesomebabyname-com" title="Awesome Baby Name on Flippa" target="_blank">Flippa</a> for $1600!</p>

        <p><a href="http://upti.lt" title="Uptilt" target="_blank">Uptilt</a> is an online multiplayer card game. I built the game in 48 hours with two friends (Gary Rennie and Oliver Cannings) as an entry into the 2012 Rails Rumble competition. My own contributions were in the backend of the game - I wrote most of the logic for managing the state of the game itself and I built the achievements engine. This project was a lot of fun and was a real eye-opener for what can be achieved in the space of a weekend.
